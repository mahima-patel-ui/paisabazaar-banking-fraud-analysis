💡 Insights Summary

🧠 OVERALL KEY PATTERNS
Top Positive Factors (Increase Credit Score):

Higher annual income

Fewer delayed payments

Older credit history

Lower number of credit cards

Lower outstanding debt

Top Negative Factors (Decrease Credit Score):

More delayed payments (strongest factor)

More credit cards and loans

High outstanding debt

Short or young credit history

Lower income

Weak/No Relationship with Credit Score:

Age

Credit utilization ratio

Month/season

Occupation

🎯 FINAL CONCLUSION

Credit score variation in this dataset is primarily behavioral, not demographic or occupational.

The strongest drivers of credit score are:

Repayment discipline (delayed payments)

Credit exposure (number of credit cards, loans)

Outstanding debt load

Credit history maturity

Income plays a supportive but secondary role.

Features like occupation, age, monthly trends, and credit utilization have minimal impact.

➡️ In short:
People’s credit score depends far more on how they manage credit, not on how much they earn or what job they have.

This insight is highly valuable for:

Credit risk modeling

Fraud detection

Loan approval automation

Customer profilin
